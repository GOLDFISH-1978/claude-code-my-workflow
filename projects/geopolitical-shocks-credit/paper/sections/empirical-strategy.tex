\section{Empirical Strategy}
\label{sec:empirical-strategy}

% --- Identification Assumption (REQUIRED — state before any result) ---
% [State the identification assumption explicitly here, e.g.:]
% "Our identification relies on the assumption that [variation] is as-good-as-randomly
%  assigned conditional on [controls/fixed effects]. Specifically, we assume that..."

% --- Institutional Setting ---
% [Why is this setting credible for identification?]

% --- Empirical Model ---
% [Write out the regression equation]

% --- Validity Tests ---
% [For DiD: parallel trends test, reference Figure X]
% [For IV: first stage, exclusion restriction defense, reference Table X]
% [For RD: density test, bandwidth sensitivity]

% --- Threats and Responses ---
% [State the main threat to identification and why it is unlikely]
