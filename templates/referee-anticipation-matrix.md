# Referee Anticipation Matrix (RAM)
**Paper:** [Paper title]
**Version:** [Draft / R&R / Revision N]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Generated by:** [AI draft / manual / both]

## How to Use This Template

**AI-assisted workflow:**
1. Run `/referee-anticipation` with your paper draft open
2. Claude generates a populated version of this matrix
3. Review, delete false positives, add concerns you know are coming
4. Update Status column as you address each concern

**Manual workflow:**
After each section of the paper, ask: *"What is the most skeptical thing a top-journal referee could say here?"*

**Status values:**
- `Open` — Not yet addressed
- `Pre-empted` — Addressed proactively in the paper
- `Appendix` — Addressed in an appendix/robustness table
- `Accepted risk` — Acknowledged as a limitation, not fixable

## Section 1: Identification Validity

| # | Concern | Severity | Pre-emptive Response | Location in Paper | Status |
|---|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| I-1 | [e.g., Instrument may be correlated with confounders via channel X] | High | [e.g., We provide placebo tests using X and show...] | Section 3.2, Table A5 | Open |
| I-2 | [e.g., Parallel trends assumption may fail due to pre-treatment divergence] | High | [e.g., Figure 2 shows parallel trends from t-5 to t-1; Table A3 reports formal test] | Figure 2, Table A3 | Open |
| I-3 | | | | | |

**Key threats to add:**
- Exclusion restriction violations (IV)
- Pre-treatment trend divergence (DiD)
- Density manipulation at cutoff (RD)
- Anticipation effects
- SUTVA violations (spillovers)

## Section 2: Data and Sample Quality

| # | Concern | Severity | Pre-emptive Response | Location in Paper | Status |
|---|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| D-1 | [e.g., Sample restricted to publicly listed banks introduces survivorship bias] | Med | [e.g., We show results are robust to including de-listed banks; Table A8] | Table A8 | Open |
| D-2 | [e.g., Variable construction deviates from Compustat standard definition] | High | [e.g., Appendix B details variable construction and reconciles with alternative definitions] | Appendix B | Open |
| D-3 | | | | | |

**Key threats to add:**
- Survivorship or selection bias in sample
- Hand-collected variable reliability
- Winsorization choices
- Sample period (does result survive GFC or COVID?)
- Data source mismatch with cited definition

## Section 3: Mechanism

| # | Concern | Severity | Pre-emptive Response | Location in Paper | Status |
|---|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| M-1 | [e.g., Mechanism is asserted but not directly tested] | High | [e.g., Section 5 provides heterogeneity tests; banks with higher X show larger effect, consistent with the proposed channel] | Section 5, Table 5 | Open |
| M-2 | [e.g., Alternative mechanism Y could also generate the observed pattern] | Med | [e.g., Section 5.3 provides direct test distinguishing X-channel from Y-channel] | Section 5.3 | Open |
| M-3 | | | | | |

**Key threats to add:**
- Mechanism asserted but not tested
- Competing channels not ruled out
- Heterogeneity analysis inconsistent with mechanism
- Placebo channels show similar effects (undermines story)

## Section 4: Alternative Explanations

| # | Concern | Severity | Pre-emptive Response | Location in Paper | Status |
|---|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| A-1 | [e.g., Result driven by confounding policy X that occurred simultaneously] | High | [e.g., Table 4 shows results are robust to excluding states/periods affected by policy X] | Table 4 | Open |
| A-2 | [e.g., Omitted variable Z correlated with both treatment and outcome] | Med | [e.g., We add Z directly in Table 3, Column 4; coefficient on D is unchanged] | Table 3, col. 4 | Open |
| A-3 | | | | | |

**Alternative explanations to consider:**
- Simultaneous policy changes
- Mean reversion / regression to mean
- Placebo treatment: does it work for pseudo-treated units?
- Competitive responses from untreated banks
- Regulatory arbitrage explanations

## Section 5: Statistical Robustness

| # | Concern | Severity | Pre-emptive Response | Location in Paper | Status |
|---|---------|----------|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| R-1 | [e.g., Result not robust to alternative clustering level] | Med | [e.g., Table A2 shows results with state-level clustering; p-value remains < 0.05] | Table A2 | Open |
| R-2 | [e.g., Coefficient economically small despite statistical significance] | Med | [e.g., Section 4.3 contextualizes magnitude: a [VERIFY: X pp] increase equals [VERIFY: Y]% of sample mean] | Section 4.3 | Open |
| R-3 | [e.g., Results driven by outliers or specific time period] | Med | [e.g., Figure A3 shows point estimate stability across dropping individual years] | Figure A3 | Open |

**Statistical concerns to address:**
- Alternative SE clustering
- Extreme observation influence (jackknife, leave-one-out)
- Sub-period stability
- Multiple testing across outcome variables
- Economic vs. statistical significance
